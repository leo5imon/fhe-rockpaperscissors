Rock Paper Scissors is a fully onchain game with secret encryption, deployed on Fhenix fhEVM. It leverages the power of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to ensure on-chain privacy, allowing for hidden actions.

I've been the first person to implement (at least publicly) WAGMI for FHE, I hope my code will be useful for future implementations.
